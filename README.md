[Base from MaruBot](https://github.com/marukrap/MaruBot)
I will remake it later or just change many part of it later.
Most of the parts I have already changed to something else but I wanna say that my base was from MaruBot by Marukrap since it is.
But I have removed many parts from it that I dont need since I have moved from SFML that MaruBot used to my own DX11 Window that uses ImGui.
I also have changed how the bot work with command to be more easy to use.
